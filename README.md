## Editorial practices

Throughout I have tried to emulate the typographical conventions of
the original fairly closely, but I have not hesitated to depart from
them where convenient.  Most such changes can pass without comment,
but one perhaps requires some justification.  In the original, there
are many instances of paragraphs that are set in a smaller type than
the main text, for example, 269 *a* and 270 *a, b*.  An examination of
the changes made in version B reveals that many of them are similarly
reduced in size, which makes me think that most if not all such
passages represent changes made in galleys.  In other words, I believe
the smaller typeface was used solely (or at least primarily) in order
to make room for late additions to the page rather than to indicate
that this material is somehow of less importance.  Especially in view
of the absence of any indication by the authors that they attach any
such meaning to variation in type size, I have not tried to preserve
such variations.  (It's possible, of course, that the smaller type
size does carry meaning in some cases, and there is sufficient
variation in style to foster doubt.  But if so, I'm unable to
distinguish the cases.)
